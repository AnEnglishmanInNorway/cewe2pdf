   # enough for our tests to produce a halfway decent pdf.

   # by the particular franchise of the cewe system

# There is a problem with the use of CEWE FranklinGothic fonts. For some reason the CEWE FG fonts
# all have the same full font name (which also happens to be the family name). Furthermore CEWE
# has not supplied an italic FG font. The code tries to take account of the full font name issue
# but even so, when the FG fonts and font family are registered with the standard "automatic"
# registration, the use of FG bold chooses the FG bolditalic font! The problem can be cured by
# manually declaring a replacement for the missing FG italic, in this case the Windows version
# of the FG italic font. Don't ask me why, I vaguely suspect the font handling in the reportlab
# pdf package!
