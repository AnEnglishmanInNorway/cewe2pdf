# Adding the entire windows fonts directory may be overkill, so you could just pick the ones

#  was neat to use, such as symbols or "script"!
# Arial = C:\WINDOWS\FONTS\ARIAL.TTF
# Arial Narrow = C:\WINDOWS\FONTS\ARIALN.TTF
# Arial Rounded MT Bold = C:\WINDOWS\FONTS\ARLRDBD.TTF
# Calibri = C:\Windows\Fonts\CALIBRI.TTF
# CalligraphScript = C:\Windows\Fonts\PALSCRI.TTF
# Calibri = C:\Windows\Fonts\calibri.ttf
# Segoe UI Symbol = C:\Windows\Fonts\seguisym.ttf
# Function = ${CEWE_FOLDER}\Resources\photofun\fonts\Function-Light.ttf

# For testing on the checkin build it would be really nice if we could upload
