# In an additional_fonts.txt file you can list individual font files or directories containing
# fonts over and above what the code loads as standard which is:
# - all fonts from the directory where the operating system installs fonts for the user
# - all fonts from the Resources/photofun/fonts directory beneath the cewe_folder

# cewe2pdf searches for just one additional_fonts.txt file, the first it can find, starting
#  with the album folder, then the current directory, then the program directory.
#  This unlike the way that it reads and combines all the cewe2pdf.ini files that it finds.
# If you want no non-standard fonts to be used, then simply place an empty additional_fonts.txt
#  file in the album folder, thereby stopping the code from looking further.

# Note that cewe2pdf does *not* load the operating system fonts (on the basis that
# CEWE might not have them, though it certainly seems that they make the Windows fonts
# available for albums), so you might want to add e.g. C:\Windows\Fonts\ to your
# additional fonts file.
