# Building a "compiled" cewe2pdf.exe
Pyhton calls this freezing instead of compiling. So the cewe2pdf is freezed.

## Method 1: using pyinstaller

    conda install pyinstaller
    pyinstaller cewe2pdf.py

This will generate two directories (build and dist). The final .exe is located in dist/cewe2pdf. But it does not work yet.

1. Create the folowing directories:
    - dist/cewe2pdf/cssselect2
    - dist/cewe2pdf/cairocffi
    - dist/cewe2pdf/tinycss2

2. Go to your anaconda3\Lib\site-packages\ folder and copy the VERSION files into the respective folder you created in the last step.

3. Copy the VERSION file from anaconda3\Lib\site-packages\cairosvg to dist\cewe2pdf

4. Copy the following files from C:\\...\anaconda3\Library\bin to dist\cewe2pdf:
    - cairo.dll
    - libpng16.dll
    - zlib.dll
    - api-ms-win-crt-runtime-l1-1-0.dll 
    - api-ms-win-crt-heap-l1-1-0.dll
    - api-ms-win-crt-stdio-l1-1-0.dll
    - api-ms-win-crt-string-l1-1-0.dll
    - api-ms-win-crt-convert-l1-1-0.dll
    - api-ms-win-crt-utility-l1-1-0.dll
    - api-ms-win-crt-math-l1-1-0.dll
    - api-ms-win-crt-locale-l1-1-0.dll
    - api-ms-win-crt-time-l1-1-0.dll
    - api-ms-win-crt-environment-l1-1-0.dll
    
    These is cairo.dll and its dependencies. You can look them up yourself using the dumpbin command from Visual Studio Compiler Tools: 
    
        dumpbin /dependents C:\anaconda3\Library\bin\cairo.dll

5. The program should work now, if not copy all the other files as well from C:\\...\anaconda3\Library\bin to dist\cewe2pdf

6. Make sure that near the top of cewe2pdf.py the current directory is added to the os.environ["PATH"]. This must happen before cairosvg is first imported from clpFile.py

7. start dist\cewe2pdf\cewe2pdf.exe to see if it starts without error

## Method 2: py2exe
    pip install py2exe

then run the installer script

    python setup.py install

The result .exe will have a problem: it can't load the cairocffi._generated folder. Not sure how to solve that.
